  Rekursive Matrix-Determinant-Solver
</h1>

> A rekursive matrix-determinant-solver just like the title says :)

## Features

--> Info: This is an old project, so don't judge. I also tried to create an actual matrix-solver that gives you the variable-values, but whatever.

**Added Features:**
- Recursive calculation of determinant
- Custom matrix class

**In Future:**
- Nothing really, maybe variable-solver...
